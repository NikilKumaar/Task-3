# Task Day 3
Here i done the task regarding the 3 activities

1.ACTIVITY 1 :

- Comparing 2 objects => It is done by taking every keys seperately with the help of for...in loop and checks every key of one object with other object using "=="
- Another way of comparing is _.isEqual(object1,object2)

2.ACTIVITY 2 :

- Use rest countries API to print the countries flags on console. It  is done by following steps
 1. Taking default XML HTTP request format on web docs.
 2. On VS code, we created a HTML file and script.js file.
 3. By using the "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all" url and with the help of for loop iteration, we print the countries flags on the console.

3.ACTIVITY 3 :

- Printing the rest countries API name,region,sub region and population in a console. Here also we need to do same process taken on ACTIVITY 2
- Instead of countries flag, we need to give 4 console.log for printing the name, region, subregion and population of the country
